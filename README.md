# README

## Overview

Welcome! Today, we’ll be focusing on your skills with Flutter by having you implement a dynamic lead flow for user registration using a given API endpoint. I’ll provide you with screenshots and an API endpoint. Your task will be to create a Flutter app that follows the design and implements the dynamic lead flow until full registration.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into several key parts:

1. **Screenshots**: These will serve as your UI guide.
2. **API Endpoint**: Used for the dynamic lead flow and registration process.
3. **Flutter Application**: The main project where you'll implement the design and logic.

## Getting Started

## Demo

Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w0_JdQCGlEO5lTLYtNpx4c2sbI5HESmF/view?usp=sharing) 
### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart: Comes with Flutter SDK
- An IDE: VSCode or Android Studio

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ahmedhesham2000/04-Acadamy-task.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. UI Design

- Follow the provided screenshots to create a responsive and attractive UI.
- Ensure all elements (buttons, text fields, etc.) are styled according to the screenshots.

### 2. API Integration

- Use the `http` package to handle HTTP requests for user registration.
- Implement error handling for network requests and API responses.
- Ensure secure storage and handling of user data.

### 3. State Management

- Utilize `cubit` for state management throughout the app.
- Ensure that state changes are efficiently managed and UI is updated accordingly.

### 4. Dynamic Lead Flow

- Implement the lead flow as per the requirements:
  - Initial lead capture
  - Intermediate steps (if any)
  - Final registration

### 5. Additional Features (Bonus)

- Any extra features or enhancements added beyond the initial requirements.

### 6. Shared Preferences

- To save user data if he not post form request if user close app berfore it use can retrive the register data.

## Bonus Features

- Describe any additional features or enhancements implemented beyond the initial requirements.

## Challenges and Learnings

### Animation

- The animation was initially difficult to implement, but once learned, it became easy to use.

### Backend

- The logic of navigating back took a short time to understand but was successfully implemented.


## Conclusion

This project aims to demonstrate your ability to build a Flutter app from design to implementation, focusing on dynamic user registration using a provided API. Follow the steps carefully, ensure you meet all requirements, and don't hesitate to add your own flair with extra features.
